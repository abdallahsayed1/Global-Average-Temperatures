# Global-Average-Temperatures

This project analyzes global temperatures from the dataset provided through the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.
The CSV files are included in the repo as well as the data manipulation done on excel.
Moving averages are used to smoothen out the data in order to make trends in the data easier to identify.
Line graphs are used to compare the average temperature throughout the years.
An analysis was done to compare the global average versus the annual average temperature of Fort Worth, Texas, USA; Shanghai, China;
and Oslo, Norway. using this data insights were drawn about the trends seen and this can be found on the *Explore weather trends* PDF.
